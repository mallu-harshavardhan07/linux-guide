What is an Operating System (OS)
An operating system (OS) is a system software that acts as an intermediate layer between the user or user applications and the physical hardware components.
Generally, we cannot communicate directly with hardware components. For example, even to save a file, we can't directly interact with the hardware. So there should be a system that helps us communicate with the physical components. That is where the operating system comes in.
The OS handles this interaction and allows users and applications to access hardware in a safe and efficient way.
Purpose of an OS

User and hardware
User applications and hardware
It manages resources and provides services such as memory management, process handling, device control, and file systems.
